# MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment

This assignment focuses on learning MongoDB fundamentals including setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.


## How to run my scripts
# üìö PLP Bookstore MongoDB Project

This project demonstrates basic and advanced MongoDB operations using a sample `books` collection for a fictional bookstore database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### Option 1: Run Locally with MongoDB Community Edition

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `insert_books.js`.
3. Run the following command to populate the database:
   ```bash
   node insert_books.js

Option 2: Use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
Set up a free cluster at MongoDB Atlas.

Replace the uri in insert_books.js with your cluster connection string.

Run the script using:

node insert_books.js

üìÇ Files Included
insert_books.js ‚Äì Script to insert sample book data into the books collection.

queries.js ‚Äì Contains all the MongoDB queries used in this project:

CRUD operations

Advanced filtering, projection, sorting, pagination

Aggregation pipelines

Indexing and performance analysis

README.md ‚Äì This file (how to run and understand the project).

screenshot.png ‚Äì MongoDB Compass or Atlas screenshot showing the populated collection.

üíª How to Run Queries
Start the Mongo shell (mongosh):
mongosh

Switch to the correct database:
use plp_bookstore

Copy and paste the content of queries.js into the shell or run them one by one as needed.

‚ùóÔ∏èNote: Comments in queries.js will be ignored by mongosh.

‚úÖ Expected Outcome
A working MongoDB database named plp_bookstore.

A populated collection named books.

Functional MongoDB queries demonstrating CRUD, advanced operations, aggregation, and indexing.

Clean code and organized scripts ready for grading.
